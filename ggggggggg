Great job on your final project submission! Your work meets all the assignment requirements and includes all the required views. I can see that you’ve taken the time to update the images with proper alternative text and revised the paragraphs as instructed. Your sketches (or detailed mockups) for each view clearly show your design intentions, and you’ve avoided using mere screenshots of completed pages.

I have tested your site on multiple devices and screen sizes, and the media queries adjust the layout as expected. The design appears responsive, and the adjustments for divs and images are consistent across your breakpoints. There are no implementation issues that I can see, and your code validates correctly with both the W3C validator and accessibility tools like WAVE.

Overall, you’ve done an excellent job moving from planning to creating your page. Keep up the good work!
